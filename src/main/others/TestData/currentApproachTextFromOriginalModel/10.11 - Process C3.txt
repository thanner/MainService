The process starts when the Resource 1 checks. Next, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the Resource 1 conducts the rejection. In the second procedure, the Resource 1 conducts the performance of measurements. Subsequently, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the Resource 1 conducts the transmission of the measured values and then conducts the transmission of readings to the sp. In the second procedure, the Resource 1 conducts the information about the failure of the reading. In any case, the process ends. The process starts when the Resource 2 requests the measurements. Next, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the Resource 2 receives a message. In the second procedure, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the Resource 2 processings of the measured values and then sendings of the changed values. In the second procedure, the Resource 2 receives a message. In any case, the process ends.
