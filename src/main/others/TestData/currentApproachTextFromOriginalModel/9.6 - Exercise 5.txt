The process starts when the Resource 1 locates and re-uses the designs. Next, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the Resource 1 creates the electrical design. The subprocess contains the following steps. The Resource 1 reviews the previous designs and then updates the electrical design. Subsequently, it tests the electrical design. As long as the ok is designed the Resource 1 repeats the latter steps and continues with reviewing the previous designs. After that, the process continues. Next, the process ends with a signal.. Subsequently, the Resource 1 sends signals. If it is required, the latter steps are repeated. In that case the Resource 1 continues with creating the electrical design. After that, the process continues. In the second procedure, the Resource 1 creates the physical design. The subprocess contains the following steps. The Resource 1 reviews the previous designs and then updates the physical design. Next, it tests the physical design. As long as the ok is designed the Resource 1 repeats the latter steps and continues with reviewing the previous designs. Subsequently, the process continues. After that, the process ends with a signal.. Next, the Resource 1 sends signals. If it is required, the latter steps are repeated. In that case the Resource 1 continues with creating the physical design. Subsequently, the process continues. After each case, the Resource 1 tests the complete design and then sents back the designs. As long as the ok is designed the Resource 1 repeats the latter steps and continues with locating. Finally, the process ends.
