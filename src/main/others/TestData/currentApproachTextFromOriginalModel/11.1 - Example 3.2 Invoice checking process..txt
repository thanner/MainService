The process starts when the Resource 1 checks an invoice for the mismatches. Next, one of the 3 alternative procedures is executed. If "no mismatches", the Resource 1 posts the invoice. If "mismatches exist but cannot be corrected", the Resource 1 blocks the invoice. If "mismatches exist but can be corrected", the Resource 1 re-sends the invoice to the customer. In any case, the Resource 1 parks the invoice. Finally, the process ends.
