When the process starts, 2 procedures are executed in an arbitrary order. The Resource 1 checks the credit history and then assesses the loan risk. In the meantime, the Resource 1 appraises the property. After each case, the Resource 1 assesses the eligibility. Next, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. If "applicant elegible", the Resource 1 prepares the acceptance pack and then sends the acceptance pack. If "applicant nor elegible", the Resource 1 rejects the application. In any case, the process ends.
