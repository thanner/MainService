The process starts when the ERPSystem checks a stock availability. Next, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. If "product in stock", the Seller retrieves the product from the warehouse. Afterwards, the ERPSystem checks the raw materials availability and then the Seller manufactures the product. In any case, the Sales confirms the order. Subsequently, 2 procedures are executed in an arbitrary order. The Seller gets the shipping address and then ships the product. In the meantime, the Sales emits the invoice and then receives the payment. After each case, the Sales archives the order. Finally, the process ends.
