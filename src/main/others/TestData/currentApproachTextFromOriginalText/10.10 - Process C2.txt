The process starts when the fault detector reports. Next, it suspects the own fault and then the mpo examines the failure. Subsequently, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the mpo rejects the failure of the fault detector. In the second procedure, the mpo confirms the failure of the fault detector and then informs the go. After that, it informs the msp and then faults at the measuring device. Next, it carrieds out and then informs the go about resolution of the interference. Subsequently, it informs the msp about resolution of the interference. In any case, the process ends.
