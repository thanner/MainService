The process starts when the Resource 1 performs a task to the locate. Next, 2 procedures are executed in an arbitrary order. The Resource 1 designs the electrical and physicals the systems. In the meantime, the Resource 1 performs a task to distribute relevant existing designs. After each case, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the Resource 1 previouses the electrical and physicals the designs be inputs. In the second procedure, the Resource 1 existings any is inputs. In any case, the Resource 1 interrupts the development of the design. Subsequently, if required, the Resource 1 stops. After that, the Resource 1 reviews the existing designs in the department and then uses the update plan. Next, it uses the existing draft of the electrical\/physical design and then creates a revised design. Subsequently, it completes and then tests the revised design. After that, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. If "the design passes the test", the Resource 1 tells the other department. If "the design fails the test", the Resource 1 sends the design back to the review and then sends the design back to create a new update plan. In any case, the Resource 1 revises the both of the designs and then combines the both of the designs. Next, it tests the both of the designs. Subsequently, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. If "the designs pass the test", the Resource 1 deems the designs complete and then sends the designs to the manufacturing process. If "the combined design fails the test", the Resource 1 sends the combined design back to initiate design cycle to the beginning. In any case, the process ends.
