The process starts when the claims officer registers a claim. Next, it examines a claim and then writes a settlement recommendation. Subsequently, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the senior claims officer conducts the not ok recommendation. In the second procedure, the senior claims officer checks the recommendation. In any case, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. If "the claim is OK", the senior claims officer claims to handle process proceeds. If "marks the claim", the senior claims officer sends the claim back to the claims officer and then repeats the recommendation. In any case, the process ends.
