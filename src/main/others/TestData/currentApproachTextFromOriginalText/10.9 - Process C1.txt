The process starts when the sp\/pu\/go requests the changes of the mpo. Next, it causes a change and then the mpo reviews the change request. Subsequently, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the mpo confirms the request of the sp\/pu\/go. In the second procedure, the mpo rejects the change of the measuring point. In any case, the mpo performs the measuring point change. After that, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the mpo reports the implementation. In the second procedure, the mpo notifies the sp\/pu\/go about failure of the changes. In any case, the process ends.
