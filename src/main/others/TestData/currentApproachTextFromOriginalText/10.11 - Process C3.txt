The process starts when the msp goes the measurements of the msp. Next, it checks the received request. Subsequently, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the msp performs the measurement. In the second procedure, the msp denies the request of the go. In any case, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the msp informs the go about failure of reading. In the second procedure, the msp transmits the measured values to the go. In any case, the go processes the measured values and then sends the changed values to the msp. After that, it goes to transmit the readings to the sp. Finally, the process ends.
