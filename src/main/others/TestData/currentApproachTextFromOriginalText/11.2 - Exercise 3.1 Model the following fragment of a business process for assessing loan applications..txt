The process starts when the loan provider approves a loan application. Next, it prepares the acceptance pack and then sends the acceptance pack to the customer. Subsequently, the acceptance pack includes a repayment schedule and then the customer needs to the agree upon. After that, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. If "the applicant agrees", the loan provider approves the application. If "the applicant disagrees with the repayment schedule", the applicant verifies the repayment agreement and then the loan provider cancels the application. In any case, the process ends.
