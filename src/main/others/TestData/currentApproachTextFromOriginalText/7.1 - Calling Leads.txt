The process starts when the manager checks the open leads. Next, he selects the top five ones and then tells the sales to call the contact person of the leads. Subsequently, the sales assistant calls the customer. After that, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the sales assistant sends a note to the manager and then the manager processes the lead. In the second procedure, the manager calls the next customer. In any case, the process ends.
