The process starts when the employee of the organization submits a vacation request. Next, it registers the requirement and then the immediate supervisor of the employee receives the request to request the vacation. Subsequently, one of the 2 alternative procedures is executed. In the first procedure, the supervisor approves the request and then generates a notification to the human resources representative. In the second procedure, the supervisor rejects the request and then returns the application to the applicant\/employee. In any case, the process ends.
